<p>Inevitable in life,
the new life dawns in me: a small
sun with roots that I will have to water deeply
and push to fight their own battle
against the weeds.</p>
<p>Small and poor bread of solidarity
flag against the cold, fresh water for the blood:
maternal elements that musn&rsquo;t withdraw
from the heart.</p>
<p>And against melancholy, faith; against
desperation,
the people&rsquo;s voice
vibrating in the windows of this secret house.</p>
<p>Discovering,
deciphering,
articulating,
setting in motion:
the old works of liberators and martyrs
that are our obligations now
and that walk around counting our steps:
from breakfast to sleep,
from secret to secret,
from action to action,
from life to life.</p>
